### Speech Board

## Overview
Speech Board is an easy to use communication app for people who cannot speak or need help being understood. It features multiple different voices with customizable options. The user can use anything from single words to creating whole sentences. The core words are organized to make them easy to find and access. The user is able to quickly create new customizable words.
